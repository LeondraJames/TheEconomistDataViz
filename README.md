Re-Imagination of The Economist: Corruption v. Development



This data visualization was inspired by a study published by The Economist in December 2011. It aims to recreate the plot detailing the positive relationship between corruption and development (with an R-sqaured of 56%). Some of the most developed countries, such as New Zealnad and Singapore, appear to be the most corrupt, according to Transparency International'sÂ annual Corruption Perceptions Index.


Original plot from the article can be found here: https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2011/12/02/corrosive-corruption 


This project was prompted from a Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp with R.
